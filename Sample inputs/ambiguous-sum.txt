# for a potential bug report. 

environment
sum : int -> (int -> bool) -> bool
greater : int -> int -> bool
truth : int -> bool

program
sum := \n: int. \k_sum: int -> bool. (n <= 0 && k_sum 0) || (n > 0 && sum n truth);
greater := \x: int. \y: int. x > y;

# 'true' is a built-in token in Z3 and hence cannot be used. 
# This is why the following top-level relational variable is named 'truth' instead of 'true'. 
truth := \x: int. 1=1;

goal
E y:int. sum y (greater y)
